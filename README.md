## MealMate
# A multi-feature meal planning app by Miles Zoltak

This is my first independent Android App!  The main purpose of it is to allow users to input ingredients they do or don't have, and be presented with ingredeints
that are relevant to those search queries.  I'm learning a lot while I do this, and below you can check out a list of things I have learned to do, or at least 
things I have encountered and tried to learn more about.



## Things I have learned so far
* Firebase and Cloud Firestore specifically, I'll have to figure out user authentification later but that shouldn't be crazy hard
* Implementing Aho-Corasick Tries, this was quite the trip and I'm still in it but I think I've got the hang of it now
* Writing Python scripts to do webscraping, and then saving those results into JSON files
* Adapting code in languages I'm less familiar with (like Node.js) to write console-based scripts for uploading files to Cloud Firestore
* Using open-source GithHub repos in my own projects
* Endless struggles (and successes) with Recycler Views
* Navigating the Android Studio ecosystem
* And probably a lot more that I am forgetting
